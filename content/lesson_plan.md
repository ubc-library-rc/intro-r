## Outline

### Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to **begin** to understand and use R and RStudio. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using R. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using R takes practice.

This is your session. If you have a question or feel we are going too fast, please let the instructor know. We can decide as a group what to cover.

### Learning Goals

* Understand the basic commands of R and how to use RStudio environment

* Learn how to load, preprocess, and explore datasets

* Learn the basic commands for descriptive statistics

* Learn basic commands for inference statistics
